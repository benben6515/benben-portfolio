        <h3>About me</h3>
        <h3>#Front-End🧙🏼 #Vim⚡ #Reading📚</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          A passionate, continuously learning Front-End developer who was born in 1995. I love sharing technology and appreciate open-source culture. I have
          hands-on experience with two Front-End frameworks (React/Vue). I look forward to developing awesome products.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Short-term goal: Familiarize myself with the usage of Vim and increase my typing speed. These skills will follow me forever. If a worker wants to do a
          good job, he must first sharpen his tools. I currently use VS Code with the Vim plugin mainly for development tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medium-term goal: Be a senior Front-End developer. I already know that Front-End is easy to learn but hard to master. Still, I keep learning and am on
          the way to becoming a senior Front-End developer. (I consider myself at this stage)
        </p>
        <p>Long-term goal: Be a "unicorn" developer. Not just limited to Front-End but also includes Back-End, Design, etc.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There are so many front-end developers, but very few are outstanding. If you think I am the candidate you are looking for, feel free to contact me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>ps. If you meet a developer with Vim, consider hire this guy!</p>
